= AsciiDoc, Gradle, Diagrams, PDF export and PDF-Theme example

This is an configured gradle project for asciidoc. Asciidoc diagrams, simple pdf theme example and gradle tasks for generating pdf and html documents are included.

NOTE: If you want to use plantUML to create class diagrams, you need to install graphviz on your local machine.

All files in `src/docs/asciidoc` will be used to generate the documents.

Simpley use `./gradlew generatePDF` or `./gradlew generateHTML` for document generation.

This is only an example, feel free to use and improve it.
